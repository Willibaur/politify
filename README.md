# Politify     
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Willibaur/politify.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Willibaur/politify)

At present is a web app allowing voters to use their postcode to find their local MP, keep track of their actions and interact with them.

### Usage

```sh
$git clone
$git@github.com:trcrossley/politify.git  
$cd politify  
$npm install  
$bower install  
$npm start  
$open http://localhost:8080
```

### Motivation
The motive behind our project was to find a solution to the common problem of voters being disconnected from politics in general and their local governance in particular.

We wanted to create a solution that would encourage voters to remain informed and feel connected to their elected local MP's
